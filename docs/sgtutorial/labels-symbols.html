<h2>Labels &amp; Symbols</h2>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Suppose you want to call some code at address $1000. CPUs
        fundamentally deal with numeric values, so the machine code to
        call it would be <code>JSR $1000</code>.  Humans tend to work better with
        words, so associating a meaningful symbol with address $1000
        can greatly improve the readability of the code: something like
        <code>JSR DrawSprite</code> is far more helpful for human readers.
        Further, once the code has been disassembled to source code, using symbols
        instead of fixed addresses makes it easier to alter the program or reuse
        the code in another project.</p>

        <p>When the target address of instructions like <code>JSR</code> and
        <code>LDA</code> falls within the scope of the data file, SourceGen classifies
        the reference as <i>internal</i>, and automatically adds a generic
        symbolic label (e.g. <code>L1000</code>).  The label can be edited if desired.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-edit-label.png" alt="t1-edit-label"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>On the line at address $2000, select
        <samp>Actions &gt; Edit Label</samp>, or double-click on the label
        "<code>L2000</code>".  Change the label to "<kbd>MAIN</kbd>", and hit
        <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd>.  The label changes on that line,
        and on the two lines that refer to address $2000.
        (If you're not sure which lines refer to address $2000,
        select line $2000 and check the list in the References window.)</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Sometimes the target address falls outside the data file.  Examples
        include calls to ROM routines, use of zero-page storage, and access to
        memory-mapped I/O locations.  SourceGen classifies these as <i>external</i>,
        and does not generate a symbol.  In an assembler source file, symbols
        for these would be expressed as equates (e.g. <code>FOO = $8000</code>),
        usually at the top of the file or in an "include file".  SourceGen
        allows you to specify symbols for addresses and numeric constants within
        the project ("<i>project symbols</i>"), or in a symbol file that can be
        included in multiple projects ("<i>platform symbols</i>").  The SourceGen
        distribution includes platform symbol files with ROM addresses for
        several common systems.</p>

    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>For an example, consider the code at address $2000, which is
        <code>LDA $3000</code>.  We want to assign the symbol "INPUT" to address
        $3000, but we can't do that by editing a label because it's not inside
        the file bounds.  We can open the project symbol editor from the project
        properties editor, or we can use a shortcut.</p>

        <p>With the line at $2000 selected, use <samp>Actions &gt; Edit Operand</samp>,
        or double-click on the value in the <samp>Operand</samp> column
        ("<code>$3000</code>").  This opens the
        Edit Instruction Operand dialog.  In the bottom left, click
        <samp>Create Project Symbol</samp>.  Set the <samp>Label</samp> field to
        "<kbd>INPUT</kbd>", and

<h4>Numeric v. Symbolic</h4>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>When SourceGen sees a reference to an address, such as the operand of an
        absolute <code>JSR</code> or <code>LDA</code>, it recognizes it
        as a <i>numeric reference</i>.  You can edit the instruction's operand
        to use a symbol instead, changing to a <i>symbolic reference</i>.
        Sometimes the way these are handled can be confusing.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-sym-2005-before.png" alt="t1-sym-2005-before"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Let's use the branch statement at $2005 to illustrate the difference.
        It performs a branch to $2009, which was automatically assigned the
        label "<samp>L2009</samp>".</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-sym-2005-labeled.png" alt="t1-sym-2005-labeled"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Edit the label at $2009 (double-click on "<samp>L2009</samp>" there),
        and change it to "<kbd>IN_RANGE</kbd>".  Line $2005 changes to match.
        This works because SourceGen
        is auto-formatting line $2005's operand based on the label it finds when it
        chases the numeric reference to $2009.
        The Info window shows this as <code>Format (auto): symbol "IN_RANGE"</code>.</p>
        <p>Use <samp>Edit &gt; Undo</samp> to revert the label change.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-sym-2005-edit.png" alt="t1-sym-2005-edit"/>

    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Edit the instruction operand at $2005 (double-click on
        "<samp>L2009</samp>" there).  Change the format to <samp>Symbol</samp>,
        and type "<kbd>IN_RANGE</kbd>" in the symbol box.
        The preview shows <samp>BCC IN_RANGE (?)</samp>, which hints at a
        problem.  Click <samp>OK</samp>.</p>

        label at $2009 has disappeared entirely.  What went wrong?</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>The problem is that we edited the operand to use a symbol that isn't
        defined anywhere.  Because "IN_RANGE" isn't defined, the operand was
        given the default format, and displayed as a hex value.
        The numeric reference to $2009 was replaced by the symbol, and nothing
        else refers to that address,
        so SourceGen no longer had any reason to put an auto-generated label
        on line $2009, which is why that disappeared.</p>

</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>The missing symbol is called out in a message window that popped up
        at the bottom of the code list window.  The message window only appears
        when there are messages to read.  You can hide the window with the
        <samp>Hide</samp> button, and make it re-appear with the button in the
        bottom right of the main window that currently says <samp>1 message</samp>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>We can resolve this issue by providing the desired symbol.  As you
        did earlier, edit the label on line $2009 (double-click in the label column)
        and set it to "<kbd>IN_RANGE</kbd>".  When you do, the operand on line $2005
        is updated appropriately.
        If you select line $2005, the Info window shows the format as
        <samp>Format: symbol "IN_RANGE"</samp>, indicating that the symbol
        was set explicitly rather than automatically.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-sym-2005-adjust.png" alt="t1-sym-2005-adjust"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Symbolic references always link to the symbol, even when the symbol
        doesn't match the numeric reference.  To see this, remove the label from
        line $2009 by undoing that change with <samp>Edit &gt; Undo</samp>,
        so the symbol is again undefined.  Now set the label on the following line,
        $200A, to "<kbd>IN_RANGE</kbd>".</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Line $2005 now says "<code>BCC IN_RANGE-1</code>".  Earlier you set
        the operand to be a symbolic reference to "<samp>IN_RANGE</samp>", but the symbol
        doesn't quite match, so SourceGen automatically adjusted the operand by
        one byte to point to the correct address.  Generally speaking, SourceGen
        will do its best to use the symbols that you tell it to, and will adjust the
        symbolic references so that the code assembles correctly.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>Edit the label on line $200A, and change it to "<kbd>NIFTY</kbd>".
        Note how the reference on line $2005 also changed.  This is an example
        of a "refactoring rename": when you changed the label, SourceGen
        automatically found everything that referred to it and updated it.
        If you edit the operand on line $2005, you can confirm that the
        symbol has changed.</p>

        <p>(If you want to clean this up before continuing on to the next
        section, put the label back on line $2009.)</p>

<h4>Non-Unique Labels</h4>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-text">
		<p>Most assemblers have a notion of "local" labels, which go out of
		scope when a non-local (global) label is encountered.  The actual
		definition of "local" is assembler-specific, but SourceGen allows you
		to create labels that serve the same purpose.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">
        <img src="images/t1-local-loop-edit.png" alt="t1-local-loop-edit"/>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
		<p>By default, newly-created labels have global scope and must be
		unique.  You can change these attributes when you edit the label.  Up near the
		top of the file, at address $1002, double-click on the label ("L1002").
		Change the label to "<kbd>LOOP</kbd>" and click the "non-unique local"
        radio button.
		Click <samp>OK</samp>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
		<p>The label at line $1002 (and the operand on line $100B) should now
		be "<samp>@LOOP</samp>".  By default, '@' is used to indicate non-unique labels,
		though you can change it to a different character in the application
		settings.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
		<p>At address $2019, double-click to edit the label ("<samp>L2019</samp>").  If
		you type "<kbd>MAIN</kbd>" or "<kbd>IS_OK</kbd>" with Global selected you'll
        get an error, but if you type "<kbd>@LOOP</kbd>" it will be accepted.  Note
        the "non-unique local" radio
		button is selected automatically if you start a label with '@' (or
		whatever character you have configured).  Click <samp>OK</samp>.</p>
		<p>You now have two lines with the same label.  In some cases the
        assembly source generator may need to "promote" them to globals, or
        rename them to make them unique, depending on what your preferred assembler
        allows.</p>

<h4>Address Region Pre-Labels</h4>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item-text">
        <p>When we created an address region at $2000, the <code>LDA</code>
        on line $1002 lost its label, and the <code>STA</code> on line $1005
        gained one.  The difficulty with having labels in both operands is that
        both instructions refer to the byte at offset +000017, but that offset has
        different addresses before and after the code is relocated, and you
        can't assign multiple addresses to a single file offset.</p>
        <p>In assembly source code, we'd solve this by putting a label right
        before the address change, and another one after.  We can do the same
        thing here by setting a "pre-label" for the address region.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item-image">

        on the operand of the <code>.addrs</code> line, i.e. "<code>$2000</code>";
        if you double-click on the <code>.addrs</code> opcode you'll jump
        to the matching <code>.adrend</code> instead).
        This opens the address region editor.  In the <samp>Pre-label</samp>
        section near the bottom, enter "<kbd>COPY_SRC</kbd>", then click
        <samp>OK</samp>.

        <p>Pre-labels are treated as "external" symbols, because the address
        they're associated with isn't actually represented by the file in its final
        form.  As a result, you can't use non-unique local names like
        <samp>@LOOP</samp>.</p>
