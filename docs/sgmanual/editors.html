<h2 id="address">Create/Edit Address Region</h2>

<p><a href="intro-details.html#address-regions">Address regions</a>
may be created, edited, resized, or removed.  Which
operation is performed depends on the current selection.  You can
specify the start and end points of a region by selecting the entire
region, or by selecting just the first and last lines.</p>
<p>In all cases, you can specify the range's initial address
as a hexadecimal value.  You can prefix it with '$', but that's not
required.
24-bit addresses may be written with a bank separator, e.g. "12/3456"
would resolve to address $123456.
If you want to set the region to be non-addressable, enter
"<code>NA</code>".</p>

<p>You can also enter a <a href="intro-details.html#pre-labels">pre-label</a>,
specify that the operand should be formatted as a
<a href="intro-details.html#relative-addr">relative address</a>,
or
<a href="intro-details.html#region-isolation">disallow address resolution</a>
across region boundaries.</p>

<p>To delete a region, click the "Delete Region" button.</p>

<h4>Create</h4>

<p>If your selection starts with a code or data line, the editor
will allow to create a new address region.  If a single line was
selected, the default behavior will be to create a region with a
floating end point.  If multiple lines were selected, the default
behavior will be to create a region with a fixed end point.</p>

<p>The address field will be initialized to the address of the
first selected line.</p>

<p>You can create a child region that shares the same start offset
as an existing region by selecting the first code or data line
within that region.  Note that regions with floating end points cannot
have the same start offset as another region.</p>

<h4>Edit</h4>

<p>If you select only the address region start line, perhaps by
double-clicking the operand there, you will be able to edit the
current region's properties.</p>

<p>If the region has a floating end point, you can choose to convert
it to a fixed end.  The end doesn't move; it just gets fixed in place.
This is a quick way to "lock down" regions once you've established
their end points.</p>

<h4>Resize</h4>

<p>If you select multiple lines, and the first line is an address
region start directive, you will be able to resize that region to
the selection.  By definition, the updated region will have a fixed
end point.</p>

<h4>Other notes</h4>

<p>There is no affordance for moving the start offset of a region.  You
must create a new region and then delete the old one.</p>

<p>Regions may not "straddle" the start or end points of other regions.</p>

<p>Double-clicking on the pseudo-opcode of a region start or end
declaration will move the selection to the other end, rather than
opening the editor.</p>

<p>To see detailed information about an address region in the "Info"
window, select the region start or end directive.  You can see the
current arrangement of address regions across your entire
project with <samp>Navigate &gt; View Address Map</samp>.</p>



<h2 id="flags">Override Status Flags</h2>

<p>The state of the processor status flags are tracked for every
instruction.  Each individual flag is recorded as zero, one, or
"indeterminate", meaning it could hold either value at the start of
that instruction.  You can override the value of individual flags.</p>
<p>The 65816 emulation bit, which is not part of the processor status
register, may also be set in the editor.</p>
<p>The M, X, and E flags will not be editable unless your CPU configuration
is set to 65816.</p>


<h2 id="label">Edit Label</h2>
<p>Sets or clears a label at the selected offset.  The label must have the
<a href="intro-details.html#about-symbols">proper form</a>, and not have the same
name as another symbol, unless it's specified to be non-unique.  If you
edit an auto-generated label you will be required to change the name.</p>
<p>The label may be marked as non-unique local, unique local, global,
or global and exported.  The default is global.  If you start typing
a label with the non-unique label prefix character (usually '@',
configurable in
<a href="settings.html#appset-displayformat">application settings</a>),
the selection will automatically switch to non-unique local.</p>
<p>Local labels may be "promoted" to global if the assembler requires it.
Most assemblers define local scope as starting clean after each global
label, but there are exceptions.  If a label's name conflicts or is
incompatible with the assembler, it will be renamed.</p>
<p>Exported labels are added to a table that may
be imported by other projects (see
<a href="advanced.html#multi-bin">Working With Multiple Binaries</a>).</p>


<h2 id="instruction-operand">Edit Operand (Instruction)</h2>
<p>Operands can be formatted explicitly, or you can let the disassembler
select the format for you.  By default, immediate constants and
addresses with no matching symbol are formatted as hex.  Symbols
defined as address labels, platform/project symbols, and local
variables will be identified and applied automatically.</p>

<h3 id="explicit-format">Explicit Formats</h3>
<p>Operands can be displayed in a variety of numeric formats, or as a
symbol.  The character formats are only available for operands
whose value falls into the proper range.  The ASCII format handles
both plain and high ASCII; the correct encoding is chosen based on
the operand's value.</p>
<p>Symbols may be used in their entirety, or, when used as constants,
can be shifted and masked.
The low / high / bank selector determines which byte is used as the
low byte.  For 16-bit operands, this acts as a shift rather than a byte
select.  If the symbol is wider than the operand field, e.g. you're
referencing a 16-bit address in an 8-bit constant, a mask will be
applied automatically.</p>
<p>The editor will try to prevent you from using auto-generated
labels and local variables in the symbol field.  These types of symbols
can be freely renamed by SourceGen, and thus cannot be reliably
referenced by name.
You can reference a non-unique local by writing it with the non-unique
label prefix character (default '@').  Ambiguous non-unique references
are not allowed, so if the symbol can't be found the label will
be discarded.</p>
<p>When you select a non-default format option, a "preview" of the
formatted operand will be shown.</p>
<p>The <code>MVN</code> and <code>MVP</code> instructions on the 65816
are a bit peculiar, because they have two operands rather than one.
SourceGen currently only allows you to set one format, which will be
applied to both operands.  If you specify a symbol, the symbol will
be used twice, adjusted if necessary.  (This limitation may be addressed
in a future release.)</p>
<p>The <code>BBR</code> and <code>BBS</code> instructions on the W65C02
also have two operands: a direct page address, and a relative branch.
In general the direct page address is ignored, so these are treated as
branch instructions.</p>

<p>The bottom part of the window has some shortcuts for working with
address references and local variables.  These are primarily used to
change the way things work when the <samp>Default</samp> format option
is selected.  The shortcuts
don't cause any changes to the recorded format of the instruction
being edited.  All of the actions can be performed elsewhere, by
editing the label at the target address, editing the project symbol
set, or editing a local variable table.</p>

<h3 id="shortcut-nar">Numeric Address References</h3>

<p>For operands that are 8-bit, 16-bit, or 24-bit addresses, you can
define a symbol for the address as a label or
<a href="intro-details.html#symbol-types">project symbol</a>.</p>
<p>If the operand is an address inside the project, you can set a
label at that address.  If the address falls in the middle of an
instruction or multi-byte data item, its position will be adjusted to
the start.  Labels may be created, modified, or (by erasing the label)
deleted.</p>
<p>The label finder does not do the optional search for "nearby" labels
that the main analyzer does, so there will be times when an instruction
that is shown with a symbol in the code list won't have a symbol
in the editor.</p>

<p>If the operand is an address outside the project, e.g. a ROM
address or I/O location, you can define a project symbol.  If a
match was found in the configured platform definition files, it will be
shown; it can't be edited, but it can be overridden by a project symbol.
You can create or modify a project symbol by clicking on
<samp>Create Project Symbol</samp> or <samp>Edit Project Symbol</samp>.
You can't delete project symbols
from this editor (use the Project Properties editor instead).</p>

<p>It's possible to have more than one project symbol for the same
address.  For example, on the Apple II, reading from the memory-mapped
I/O address $C000 returns the last key pressed, but writing to it
changes the state of the 80-column display hardware, so it's useful to
have two different names for it.  If more than one project symbol has the
same address, the first one found will be used, which may not be
what is desired.  In such situations, you should create the project
symbol and then copy the symbol name into the operand.  You can do this
in one step by clicking the <samp>Copy to Operand</samp> button.
(In most cases you don't want to do this, because if the project
symbol is deleted or renamed, you'll have operands that refer to a
nonexistent symbol.  Unlike labels, project symbol renames do not
refactor the rest of the project.)

<h3 id="shortcut-local-var">Local Variable References</h3>

<p>For zero-page address operands and (65816-only) stack-relative
constant operands, a
<a href="intro-details.html#local-vars">local variable</a>
can be created or modified.  This
requires that a local variable table has been defined at or before
the instruction being edited.</p>
<p>If an existing entry is found, you will be able to edit the name
and comment fields.  If not, a new entry with a generic name and
pre-filled value field will be prepared in the nearest prior table.</p>


<h2 id="data-operand">Edit Operand (Data)</h2>

<p>This dialog offers a variety of choices, and can be used to apply a
format to multiple lines.  You must select all of the bytes you want
to format.  For example, to format two bytes as a 16-bit word, you must
select both bytes in the editor.  (If you click on the first item, then
Shift+double-click on the operand field of the last item, you can do
this very quickly.)  The selection does not need to be contiguous: you
can use Control+click to select scattered items.</p>
<p>If the range is discontiguous, crosses a logical boundary
such as a change in address or a user-specified label, or crosses a
visual boundary like a long comment, note, or visualization, the selection
will be split into smaller regions.  A message at the
top of the dialog indicates how many bytes have been selected, and how
many regions they have been divided into.</p>
<p>(End-of-line comments do <i>not</i> split a region, and will
disappear if they end up inside a multi-byte data item.)</p>

<p>The <samp>Simple Data</samp> items behave the same as their equivalents
in the Edit Operand (Instruction) dialog.  However, because the width is
not determined by an instruction opcode, and multiple items can be selected,
you will need to specify how wide each item is and what its byte order is.
For data you also have the option of setting the format to
<samp>Address</samp>, which marks the selected bytes as a
numeric reference.</p>

<p>Consider a simple example: suppose you find a table of 16-bit
addresses in the code.  Click on
the first byte, shift-click the last byte, then select the Edit Data menu
item.  The number of bytes selected should be even.  Select
<samp>16-bit words, little-endian</samp>, then over to the right click on
<samp>Address</samp>.  When you click <samp>OK</samp>, the selected data
will be formatted as a series of 16-bit address values.  If the addresses
can be resolved inside the data file, each address will be assigned
an automatically-generated label.</p>

<p>The <samp>Bulk Data</samp> items can represent large chunks of data
compactly.  The <samp>Fill</samp> option is only available if all selected
bytes have the same value.</p>
<p>If a region of bytes is used for data storage, but the initial values
don't matter, you can mark it as <samp>Uninitialized data</samp>.
(Note that the code generated will usually use an initialized bulk data
directive rather than a "leave space" directive, because SourceGen wants
to guarantee that the assembled binary matches the original.)</p>
<p>If a region of bytes is irrelevant, e.g. dead code or padding,
you can mark it as <samp>Junk</samp>.  If it appears to be adding bytes
to reach a power-of-two address boundary, you can designate it as an alignment
directive.  If you have multiple regions selected, only the alignment
options that work for all regions will be shown.</p>
<p>If you want to import a section of the file as a binary file, rather
than representing it in the assembly source, you can set the region as
a <samp>Binary Include</samp>.  These sections must be for a single
unbroken section of the file.  Assign a filename to use for the output
file.  Filenames may be partial paths, but may not reference directories
above the project directory (with "..") or include double quotes (which
would require escaping in the assembler output).  Each binary include
directive must output to a different filename (case-insensitive).  During
assembly source generation, existing files will only be overwritten if
they have the same length as the binary include; if they have a different
length, an error will be reported.</p>

<p>The <samp>String</samp> items are enabled or disabled depending on
whether the data you have selected is in the appropriate format.  For example,
<samp>Null-terminated strings</samp> is only enabled if the data regions are
composed entirely of characters followed by $00.  Zero-length strings
are allowed.
DCI (Dextral Character Inverted) strings have the high bit on the last
byte flipped; for PETSCII this will usually look like a series of
lower-case letters followed by a capital letter, but may look odd if the
last character is punctuation (e.g. '!' becomes $A1, which is a
rectangle glyph that will be displayed as a hex value).</p>
<p>The character encoding can be selected, offering a choice between
plain ASCII, low + high ASCII, C64 PETSCII, and C64 screen codes.  When
you change the encoding, your available options may change.  The
low + high ASCII setting will accept both, configuring the appropriate
encoding based on the data values, but when identifying multiple strings
it requires that each individual string be entirely one or the other.</p>
<p>Due to fundamental limitations of the character set, C64 screen code
strings cannot be null terminated ($00 is '@').</p>

<p>As noted earlier, to avoid burying elements such as labels in the middle
of a data item, contiguous areas may be split into smaller regions.  This
can sometimes have unexpected effects.  For example, this can be formatted
as two 16-bit words or one 32-bit word:</p>
<pre>
         .DD1    $01
         .DD1    $ef
         .DD1    $01
         .DD1    $f0
</pre>

<p>With a label in the middle, it can be formatted as two 16-bit words, but
not as a 32-bit word:</p>
<pre>
         .DD1    $01
         .DD1    $ef
LABEL    .DD1    $01
         .DD1    $f0
CODE     LDA     LABEL
</pre>

<p>If this is undesirable, you can add a label at a 32-bit boundary, and
reference that instead:</p>
<pre>
LABEL    .DD1    $01
         .DD1    $ef
         .DD1    $01
         .DD1    $f0
CODE     LDA     LABEL+2
</pre>

<p>With the label out of the way, the data can be formatted as desired.</p>


<h2 id="comment">Edit Comment</h2>
<p>Enter an end-of-line (EOL) comment, or leave the text field blank to
delete it.  EOL comments may be placed on instruction and data lines, but
not on assembler directives.</p>
<p>It's wise to restrict comments to the ASCII character set, because
not all assemblers can accept UTF-8 input.  Code generators for such
assemblers will convert non-ASCII characters to '?' or something similar.
If this isn't a concern, you can enter any characters you like.</p>
<p>There is no fixed limit on the number of characters, but you may
want to limit the overall length if you're hoping to create 80-column
output.  Some retro assemblers may have hard line length limitations,
which could result in the comment being truncated in generated sources.</p>
<p>A semicolon (';') is placed at the start of the comment.  If an assembler
has different conventions, a different delimiter character may be used.  You
don't need to include a delimiter explicitly in the comment field.</p>

<p>Comments on platform symbols are read from the platform symbol file, and
cannot be edited from within SourceGen.  Comments on project symbols are
stored in the project file, and can be edited with the project symbol
editor.</p>


<h2 id="long-comment">Edit Long Comment</h2>

<p>Long comments can be arbitrarily long and span multiple lines.  They
will be word-wrapped at a line width of your choosing.  They're always
drawn with a fixed-width font, so you can create ASCII-art diagrams.
Comment delimiters are added automatically at the start of each line.</p>

<p>The bottom window will update automatically as you type, showing what
the output is expected to look like.  The actual assembler source output
will depend on features of the target assembler, such as comment
delimiter choices and maximum line length limitations.  For example,
Merlin allows a leading '*' to indicate a full-line comment, while most
others use ";'.</p>

<p>Clear the text field to delete the comment.</p>
<p>You can use <kbd class="key">Ctrl+Enter</kbd> as a keyboard shortcut
for <samp>OK</samp>.</p>

<p>The long comment at the very top of the project is special, as it's
not associated with a file offset.  If you delete it, you can get it
back by using <samp>Edit &gt; Edit Header Comment</samp>.</p>

<p>Recent versions of SourceGen support "fancy" formatting tags, which
are embedded in the comment like BBCode or HTML.  You can choose to
use "classic" or "fancy" formatting by clicking the
<samp>Enable Fancy Formatting</samp> checkbox.</p>

<h3>Classic Formatting</h3>

<p>If fancy formatting is disabled, you can set the line width for the
comment block from the choices in the pop-up menu.  If you want to
wrap the comment in a box of asterisks, check the
<samp>Render In Box</samp> checkbox.</p>
<p>For boxed text, most assemblers don't accept '*' as a full-line comment
delimiter, so the actual delimiter will be output at the start of each
line.  This reduces the width of the box by 1 for those assemblers and
the on-screen display.</p>
<p>Within a box, putting '*' on a line by itself causes a full line of
asterisks to be output.</p>

<h3>Fancy Formatting</h3>

<p>If fancy formatting is enabled, the width and box controls are disabled
in the dialog.  The features are available with embedded formatting
commands.</p>
<p>The supported tags are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>[width=nn]</code>: sets the line width to the specified value.
    The minimum width is 8, maximum is 128.  The special value '*' sets
    the width to the default (80).  This is the total width of the output,
    so the actual text width will be slightly smaller because of comment
    delimiters and box edges.</li>
  <li><code>[br]</code>: breaks up the output with a totally blank line.
    The line won't even have a comment delimiter.</li>
  <li><code>[box]...[/box]</code>: formats the text inside the tags in
    a box.  The box frame will be composed of comment delimiters (usually
    '<code>;</code>' or '<code>*</code>').</li>
  <li><code>[box char='#']</code>: alternate form of <code>[box]</code>
    that allows the frame character to be specified.  Because lines will
    need to be prefixed with a comment delimiter, the box width is
    reduced by one.  If the specified character happens to match the
    comment delimiter, the comment delimiter will be omitted, but the
    width will still be reduced so that the inside of the box is the same
    width regardless of assembler configuration.</li>
  <li><code>[hr]</code>: outputs a horizontal line of characters, using
    the comment char.</li>
  <li><code>[hr char='-']</code>: outputs a horizontal line of characters,
    using the specified char.</li>
  <li><code>[url]https://example.com/[/url]</code>: outputs a URL.</li>
  <li><code>[url=https://example.com/]link text[/url]</code>: outputs
    the link text followed by the URL.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>width</code> and <code>br</code> tags are not allowed in
boxes, but the <code>hr</code> and <code>url</code> tags are.</p>

<p>For example, the text:</p>
<pre>
[width=20][box]
Hello, world!
[hr char='-']
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
[/box]
</pre>
<p>will be formatted as:</p>
<pre>
********************
* Hello, world!    *
*------------------*
* The quick brown  *
* fox jumps over   *
* the lazy dog.    *
********************
</pre>

<p>Incomplete or malformed format tags will be output as written.  To
avoid confusing the parser, the left bracket can be escaped with a
backslash, e.g. "<code>\[br]</code>" will appear in the output as
"<code>[br]</code>".</p>

<p>A quick reference for the format tags can be accessed with the
<samp>Format Help</samp> button.</p>


<h2 id="data-bank">Edit Data Bank (65816 only)</h2>

<p>Sets the Data Bank Register (DBR) value for 65816 code.  This is used
when matching 16-bit address operands with labels.  The new value is
in effect from the line where it's declared to the end of the file, even
across bank boundaries.
If you leave the text field blank, the directive will be removed.</p>
<p>A hexadecimal value from $00 to $ff can be entered directly.  As
with other address inputs, a leading '$' is not required.  Entering
"K" will set the DBR to the current address, and will automatically
update if you change the address to a different bank.</p>
<p>The pop-up menu has a list of all banks that hold code or data.
To make them easier to identify, each is shown with the label on the
first address in the bank, if any.</p>
<p>While you can override automatically-generated data bank change
directives, you can't remove them individually.  You can disable
automatic generation by un-checking "smart PLB handling" in the project
properties.</p>
<p>Because the directive is frequently associated with <code>PLB</code>
instructions, double-clicking on a <code>PLB</code> opcode in the
code list will open the editor.</p>


<h2 id="note">Edit Note</h2>
<p>Notes are similar to long comments, in that they can be arbitrarily
long and span multiple lines.  However, because they're never included
in generated output, options like line width formatting and boxing
aren't relevant.</p>
<p>Instead, you can select a highlight color for the note to make it
stand out.  You may want to assign certain colors to specific things,
e.g. blue for "I don't know what this is" or green for "this is a
bookmark for the really interesting stuff".  The color will be applied
to the note in the code list and in the "Notes" window.</p>
<p>If you don't like the standard colors you can define your own.
You can do this with web RGB syntax, which uses a '#' followed by
two hex digits per channel.  For example, bright red is
<code>#ff0000</code>, while teal is <code>#008080</code>.  You can
also simply type a color name like "violet" so long as it appears in the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/media/art-color-table.png?view=netframework-4.8">list of Microsoft .NET colors</a>.</p>

<p>Clear the text field to delete the note.</p>
<p>You can use <kbd class="key">Ctrl+Enter</kbd> as a keyboard shortcut
for <samp>OK</samp>.</p>


<h2 id="project-symbol">Edit Project Symbol</h2>
<p>This is used to edit the properties of a project symbol.</p>
<p>Symbols marked as "address" will be applied automatically when an
operand references an address outside the scope of the data file.  They
will not be applied to addresses inside the data file.  Symbols
marked as "constant" are not applied automatically, and must be
explicitly specified as an operand.</p>
<p>The label must meet the criteria for symbols (see
<a href="intro-details.html#about-symbols">All About Symbols</a>), and must
not have the same name as another project symbol.  It can overlap
with platform symbols and user labels.</p>
<p>The value may be entered in decimal, hexadecimal, or binary.  The numeric
base you choose will be remembered, so that the value will be displayed
the same way when used in a <code>.EQ</code> directive.</p>
<p>You can optionally provide a width for address symbols.  For example,
if the address is of a two-byte pointer or a 64-byte buffer, you would
set the width field to cause all references to any location in that range
to be set to the symbol.  Widths may be entered in hex or decimal.  If
the field is left blank, a width of 1 is assumed.  Overlapping symbols
are allowed.  The width is ignored for constants.</p>
<p>If you enter a comment, it will be placed at the end of the line of
the <code>.EQ</code> directive.</p>
<p>For address symbols that represent a memory-mapped I/O location, it
can be useful to have different symbols for reads and writes.  Use
the <samp>Read</samp>/<samp>Write</samp> checkboxes to specify the
desired behavior.</p>


<h2 id="lvtable">Create/Edit Local Variable Table</h2>
<p><a href="intro-details.html#local-vars">Local variables</a> are arranged in
tables, which are created at a specific file offset.  They must be
associated with a line of code, and are usually placed at the start of
a subroutine.
The <samp>Create Local Variable Table</samp> action creates a new table, and
opens the editor.  The <samp>Edit Prior Local Variable Table</samp> searches
for the closest table that appears at or before the selected line,
and edits that.</p>
<p>The editor allows you to create, edit, and delete entries, as well
as move and delete entire tables (though these last two options are not
available when creating a new table).  Empty tables are allowed.  These
can be useful if the "clear previous" flag is set.  If you want to
delete the table, click the <samp>Delete Table</samp> button.</p>
<p>Use the buttons to add, edit, or remove individual variables.  Each
variable has a name, a value, a width, and an optional comment.  The
standard naming rules for symbols apply.  Variables are only used for
zero-page and stack-relative operands, so all values must fall in the
range 0-255.  The width may extend one byte past the end (to address $0100)
to allow 16-bit accesses to $ff (particularly useful on 65816).</p>
<p>You can move a table to any offset that is the start of an instruction
and doesn't already have a local variable table present.  Click the
<samp>Move Table</samp> button and enter the new offset in hex.  You can
also click on the up/down buttons to move to the next valid offset.</p>
